Author: John Vincent Postrano

## Description: 
<b>`CipherTool`</b> is a terminal-based program that contains various encryption ciphers for users. There are currently 4 ciphers included in <b>`CipherTool`</b>. Each cipher has two options in which a user can choose. A user can either add a text file (.txt) for the cipher to read and encrypt; or, the user can type in their own text on what to encrypt.

### Ciphers:
<ul>
  <li>Caesar Cipher</li>
  <li>Vigenere Cipher</li>
  <li>XoR Cipher</li>
  <li>Enigma Cipher</li>
</ul>
